                   This library contains types used by the `R.generated.swift` file that is normally generated by R.swift. R.swift depends on this pod to include some types and other libraries can use this project to extend R.swift types.

                   R.swift is a tool to get strong typed, autocompleted resources like images, fonts and segues in Swift projects.
